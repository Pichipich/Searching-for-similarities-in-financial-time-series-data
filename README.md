# Searching for similarities in financial time series data

The objective of this project is to explore and analyze the effectiveness 
of clustering algorithms in identifying similarities within financial time series data. 
The financial datasets used include stock prices (open, close, adj close and volume prices) and mutual fund returns, 
with the goal of determining how well different clustering methods and distance metrics can group similar financial instruments together.

Methods
The project utilizes the following clustering algorithms and distance metrics:

Clustering Algorithms:

K-Medoids
Hierarchical Clustering
Distance Metrics:

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
Kendall's Tau
Euclidean Distance
