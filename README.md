# Searching-for-similarities-in-financial-time-series-data

The objective of this project is to explore and analyze the effectiveness 
of clustering algorithms in identifying similarities within financial time series data. 
The financial datasets used include stock prices and mutual fund returns, 
with the goal of determining how well different clustering methods and distance metrics can group similar financial instruments together.
